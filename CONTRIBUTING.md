## 🐛 Opening Issues

If you find a bug, want a feature, or have a question:

- First, **search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
- If none exist, open a new issue with:
  - A clear title
  - A detailed description
  - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
  - Screenshots or logs if helpful
- Tag the issue type if possible:
  - `[bug]`, `[feature]`, `[ui]`, `[backend]`, `[ai]`, `[docs]`

## 🔁 Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a PR:

- Keep pull requests **small and focused**
- Clearly describe:
  - What problem you’re solving
  - How you solved it
  - Any related issue numbers
- Ensure:
  - The app builds successfully
  - No TypeScript errors (`npm run check`)
  - Existing features are not broken

Large or experimental changes are best discussed in an issue first.

If you’d like to contribute by adding:
